# [Sports Schedule Background Generator](http://ssbg.herokuapp.com)

Sports Schedule Background Generator (not the most creative name) is a web app used to create background images based on a sport team's schedule.
Currently, it only supports the 2015 regular season schedule for NCAA FBS teams.

The schedule comes from [ncaa.org](http://www.ncaa.org/championships/statistics/football-schedules)  
The logos come from [sportslogos.net](http://www.sportslogos.net), but everything was conveniently downloaded from a google drive folder created by reddit user [dybuell](https://www.reddit.com/user/dybuell) - see [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/3fvdmb/its_time_im_back_with_a_preview_guide_for_the/)
